fine as long as we have to do some classification and pre/pro processing.
read entire number not just single digit. (important)
process of learning the network, and steps needed to set up.
probability map, how to process it.
how network will work with perspective distortions
clasify perspective distorted data with normal data.
how big can the number be? (build an image parameter) 

work in parallel (it has to be specified in the proposal, as detailed as possible)
example images of what is input and what is output
